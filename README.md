This is the repository for my attempt at the etch-a-sketch exercise of The Odin Project. https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project 
It was a great exercise in DOM manipulation and breaking problems down into smaller pieces. I learned more about CSS grid and got some more practice with flexbox. I also had more practice with event listeners. It was fun figuring out how to make the range slider change the grid size. Best of all I made something I enjoy playing with! 
For a future side project I might try to make it mobile and tablet friendly, so it can be used with a stylus pen or finger.
